<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instant Coffee Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray-drying</li><li>Freeze-drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The instant coffee market primarily consists of two main types: spray-drying and freeze-drying. Spray-drying involves atomizing brewed coffee into fine droplets, which are then rapidly dried with hot air, resulting in a fine powder. This method is cost-effective and retains a portion of the coffee's flavor. In contrast, freeze-drying preserves more of the original taste and aroma by freezing brewed coffee and then reducing the surrounding pressure to remove ice. Both methods cater to varying consumer preferences for quality and convenience.</p></p>
