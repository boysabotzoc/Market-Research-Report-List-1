<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive NVH Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided Sealing Tape</li><li>Double-sided Sealing Tape</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) Tapes market comprises two primary types: single-sided sealing tape and double-sided sealing tape. Single-sided sealing tape primarily functions as a barrier to seal gaps, reducing noise and vibrations from the vehicle’s interior. In contrast, double-sided sealing tape provides dual adhesion, allowing for more robust applications by bonding two surfaces together while simultaneously dampening sound and vibrations. Both types are essential for enhancing vehicle comfort and improving overall acoustic performance.</p></p>
