<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beverage Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The beverage pumps market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational energy to move liquids, making them ideal for high flow rates and low-viscosity beverages. They are efficient for transferring large volumes quickly. In contrast, positive displacement pumps work by trapping a fixed amount of liquid and forcing it through the discharge, providing precise flow control and handling viscous fluids effectively. Both types cater to the diverse needs of the beverage industry in production and distribution.</p></p>
