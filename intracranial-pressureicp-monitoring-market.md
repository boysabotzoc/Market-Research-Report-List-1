<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure(ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring involves assessing pressure within the skull to detect conditions like traumatic brain injury or stroke. The market is segmented into two main types: invasive and non-invasive monitors. Invasive ICP monitors involve the placement of sensors directly within the cranial cavity, providing real-time pressure readings but requiring surgical procedures. Non-invasive ICP monitors utilize methods such as imaging or external sensors, offering a safer alternative with less risk, though typically with lower accuracy compared to invasive methods.</p></p>
